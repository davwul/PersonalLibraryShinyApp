                      Flavivirus infections pose a significant global health burden, highlighting the need for safe and effective vaccination strategies. Co-administration of different vaccines, including licensed flavivirus vaccines, is commonly practiced providing protection against multiple pathogens while also saving time and reducing visits to healthcare units. However, how co-administration of different flavivirus vaccines
